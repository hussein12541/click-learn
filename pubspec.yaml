# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/logo/hussein.png
    - assets/logo/logo.png
    - assets/images/images/
    - assets/json/loading.json
    - assets/json/dark_loading.json
    - assets/json/splash.json
    - assets/json/no_internet.json
    - assets/json/camera.json
    - assets/json/security.json
    - assets/json/camera1.json
    - assets/images/images/myLearning.svg
    - assets/images/images/exam_icon.svg
    - assets/json/bad.json
    - assets/json/celebrate.json
    - assets/images/images/posts_icon.svg
    - assets/json/third.json
    - assets/json/second.json
    - assets/json/first.json
    - shorebird.yaml

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:


  fonts:
    - family: Cairo
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo-Bold.ttf
          style: italic


    - family: Cairo_regular
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo-Bold.ttf
          style: italic

  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
